CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS - INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1. DATASET OVERVIEW
------------------
- Total Records: 10,000 customers
- Features: 14 columns (including target variable 'Exited')
- No missing values in the dataset
- Mix of numerical and categorical features

2. CHURN DISTRIBUTION
--------------------
- Churned customers: 20.37%
- Non-churned customers: 79.63%
INSIGHT: Significant class imbalance present

3. CORRELATION ANALYSIS
----------------------
Strong Correlations:
a) Age vs Churn (0.29): Positive correlation
   - Older customers are more likely to churn
b) IsActiveMember vs Churn (-0.16): Negative correlation
   - Active members are less likely to churn
c) Balance vs NumOfProducts (-0.30): Negative correlation
   - Customers with more products tend to have lower balances

4. KEY FEATURES
--------------
Numerical Features:
- CreditScore (350-850)
- Age (18-92)
- Tenure (0-10)
- Balance (0-250,898)
- NumOfProducts (1-4)
- EstimatedSalary

Categorical Features:
- Geography (France, Spain, Germany)
- Gender (Male, Female)
- HasCrCard (0,1)
- IsActiveMember (0,1)

RECOMMENDED APPROACH
------------------
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handle class imbalance using SMOTE or class weights
   - Scale numerical features (especially Balance and EstimatedSalary)
   - Encode categorical variables (Geography and Gender)
   Reason: Ensure model isn't biased by imbalanced classes or feature scales

2. Feature Engineering:
   a) Create age groups/bins
      Reason: Strong correlation with churn suggests age segments might have different behaviors
   
   b) Create interaction features:
      - Age × Balance
      - Tenure × NumOfProducts
      - IsActiveMember × Age
      Reason: Capture complex relationships between correlated features

   c) Create ratio features:
      - Balance/EstimatedSalary
      - Balance/Age
      Reason: Derive meaningful financial indicators

3. Model Selection Strategy:
   a) Start with interpretable models:
      - Logistic Regression
      - Decision Trees
      Reason: Understanding feature importance and business rules

   b) Then try advanced models:
      - Random Forest
      - XGBoost
      Reason: Better handling of non-linear relationships and feature interactions

4. Evaluation Focus:
   - Use precision-recall metrics over accuracy
   - Focus on recall for churned customers
   Reason: Cost of missing a potential churner is higher than falsely identifying a non-churner

5. Business Recommendations:
   a) Age-based retention strategies
   b) Active membership benefits
   c) Product portfolio optimization
   Reason: Align with strongest correlating factors

PRIORITY AREAS FOR INVESTIGATION
------------------------------
1. Age-related churn patterns
2. Active membership impact
3. Product-balance relationship
4. Geographic differences in churn
5. Customer tenure patterns

Note: Keep the level 2 project structure in mind - ensure proper modularization, version control, and experiment tracking throughout the implementation.
