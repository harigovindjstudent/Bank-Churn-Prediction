# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the banking sector using machine learning techniques. Customer churn, or customer attrition, refers to when customers stop doing business with a bank. By identifying customers who are likely to churn, banks can take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various features about bank customers including:
- Demographic information (age, gender, geography)
- Banking relationship attributes (credit score, tenure, balance)
- Product usage (number of products, credit card status, active member status)
- Financial metrics (estimated salary)
- Target variable: 'Exited' (whether the customer has churned or not)
