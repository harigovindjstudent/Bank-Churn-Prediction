# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
🏦 A machine learning project that predicts customer churn in the banking sector with 84% accuracy. Built using scikit-learn and MLflow, this solution helps banks identify customers at risk of leaving, enabling proactive retention strategies. Features include automated data preprocessing, advanced feature engineering, and comprehensive model experimentation tracking. The project follows industry-standard practices with modular code structure, version control, and detailed documentation.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various features about bank customers including:
- Demographic information (age, gender, geography)
- Banking relationship attributes (credit score, tenure, balance)
- Product usage (number of products, credit card status, active member status)
- Financial metrics (estimated salary)
- Target variable: 'Exited' (whether the customer has churned or not)
